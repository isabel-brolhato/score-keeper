# Score Keeper

The score keeper allows the user to keep track of ping pong scores.

The user is able to select the number of points the players will play to.

To keep track of the score, for every scored point in the game, the user clicks a button to assign the point to either player one or player two.

Once either player reaches the previously selected number of points, the display turns the winner's score to green, and the loser's score to red. At this point, the functionality of the buttons to assign points to the players is disabled.

The user is able to click the ''reset'' button to start over, with the players scores being  reset to 0, and the buttons to assign points to each player has its functionality restored.
